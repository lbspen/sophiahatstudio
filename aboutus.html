<h3>In the beginning... </h3>


    
<p>There were two blokes who fancied themselves as musicians. They
didn't know each other, but they both had been playing their axes for
awhile and were obsessed with recording themselves and their friends,
and their friends' friends.. As time passed, they gathered more gear
and gadgets and tried to figure out how to use them. In order to regain
a taste of structured learning they enrolled in some audio classes at a
local college. It was there that they met and realized that each others
gear was compatible (sort of like the Brady Bunch) and a friendship was
struck. </p>

<h3>No, this is how it really happened... </h3>


    
<p>"Tom and I did some projects together at Shoreline Community
College. I was getting some work at my place and asked him if he wanted
to help out. I've always been thinking about doing this with other
people rather than alone. I think its another example of the sum being
greater than all of the parts. Tom and I work together well as a team,
we share a similar vision about where we want to take it. Our musical
tastes are diverse enough to give us a broad range of musical
sensibilities, though there's enough common ground to keep us on the
same page most of the time." <em>Chris Spencer</em> </p>


    
<p>Collectively, Tom and Chris have about 30 years of recording
experience. They have recorded rock projects, big band jazz, classical
chamber music, country, blues,R&amp;B, techno, dance and pop projects.
In addition to recording bands, they have fallen into several sound for
video , documentary, and web audio projects. </p>
