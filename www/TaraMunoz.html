Tara has been in love with sound and its effects on people since she was little. At the ripe ol&#39; age of two she exercised the power of her voice on her parents; noticing that the louder she got, more time was spent in solitude. She has spent years experimenting and fine tuning her understanding of those effects.
Tara has spent years in the film world doing location sound recording. Along with the technical aspect of creating a relationship between images and sound, she loves to build her library of sound effects using her ninja skills. In 2009, she spent a week and a half hiding in a downtown Seattle dumpster to capture the realistic toss and land of a bag of garbage to use in a feature sci-fi. Back in 2001, she spent a half a year wandering around East Africa with a recorder in hand; no distance stops her from capturing the absolute best sounds for the job!

                In 2008 she decided to become official. She entered the education system and by 2010 graduated with two degrees, one in Audio Engineering and another in Writing and Directing for the Camera. By 2011 she had worked in over 30 films as a production sound mixer and boom operator. Projects such as 48hr contests, commercials, shorts and feature length films are what keep her motivated to go on living.
Currently she is stepping into the world post production for movies as well as the world of theatre building audio-scapes.
