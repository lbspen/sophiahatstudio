                  <strong>In the beginning...</strong> 
There were two blokes who fancied themselves as musicians. They didn't know each other, but they both had been playing their
axes for awhile and were obsessed with recording themselves and their friends, and their friends' friends.. As time passed,
they gathered more gear and gadgets and tried to figure out how to use them. In order to regain a taste of structured learning
they enrolled in some audio classes at a local college. It was there that they met and realized that each others gear was compatible
(sort of like the Brady Bunch) and a friendship was struck.

                 <strong> No, this is how it really happened...</strong>
"Tom and I did some projects together at Shoreline Community College. I was getting some work at my place
and asked him if he wanted to help out. I've always been thinking about doing this with other people rather
than alone. I think its another example of the sum being greater than all of the parts. Tom and I work together
well as a team, we share a similar vision about where we want to take it. Our musical tastes are diverse enough
to give us a broad range of musical sensibilities, though there's enough common ground to keep us on the same
page most of the time." Chris Spencer </p>
               <p>
                In 2009, Chris and Tara crossed paths and worked together on a couple of projects. She is so easy to work with and has a great perspective and ears, which makes everyone feel super comfortable.  Recently, she has agreed to be part of our team and help diversify our offerings. Her expertise in location recording, foley and EFX is a welcome edition.   
               </p>
               <p>

Collectively, Tom and Chris have about 30 years of recording experience. They have recorded rock projects, big band
jazz, classical chamber music, country, blues,R&amp;B, techno, dance and pop projects. In addition to recording bands, they
have fallen into several sound for video, documentary, and web audio projects.
