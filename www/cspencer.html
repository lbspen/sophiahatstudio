The founder of SophiaHat and a guitar performance graduate of Berklee College of music,
Chris has been actively playing, teaching and recording since 1987.  An east coast native,
Chris moved to Seattle in 1998 after spending a few years in the Air Force Band.
Primarily a jazz guitarist, he has played with artists such as Ernie Watts,
Gene Bertoncini, Tim Ries, and many local jazz greats.Ê Although still actively
involved in the Seattle jazz community, Chris manages to juggle the life of a working
musician with the challenges of being an audio engineer.  When Chris is not in the
studio or playing around town, he enjoys sailing, biking and playing with his kids.  
As an engineer, Chris has worked on many music projects as well as audio for radio,
games, and film.
