                           MultiFormat Digital Recording
                           <br />
                           We are a digital based multitrack studio and offer several recording
                           mediums. Most of the work we do however is in  ProTools. Currently we run
                           Pro Tools 9 with a Black Lion modified 002 system. Although it is not a TDM system, we use the
                           Complete Production Toolkit to unlock all of the features of the larger TDM systems.  For the
                           clients that means higher track counts, more editing features like Beat Detective across multiple
                           tracks, multitrack Quickpunch, ultrasmooth pitch and time editing, etc,.  We can also accommodate
                           projects in Logic and Digital Performer.  Projects can be delivered in
                           these formats as well as all other standard mix formats.  In addition to
                           ProTools, we use Audition, Waveburner and an Alesis Masterlink for
                           mastering projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           Although we work mostly in the box, both locations use digital mixers for monitoring
                           during tracking and occasionally for summing at mixdown. While we do not depend on
                           them to shape the sound or use their converters, we treat them like control surfaces
                           with digital patching capabilities.  The Green Lake location uses a Tascam DM24 and
                           the Lake City space uses a Mackie D8B.

                           We have recently added a Fandrich 6' 8 grand piano to our main room.
                           It is absolutely a wonderful instrument to play and record.  Check out

                           At our Green Lake location we have pairs of Genelec 1031s and Event PS6s for stereo monitoring.  For mixing in 5.1 we use the ADAM A3x for L,C,R,LS,RS along with the ADAM Sub 12.  
                           At Lake City there are Mackie HR824s.

                           One trait that sets us apart from other small studios is our individual monitoring
                           setup. <a href="http://www.aviom.com/adspProducta16ii.cfm?sec=products&amp;cat=pro16&amp;ln=a16II">
                              Headphone mixers by Aviom</a> and video camera/monitor stations for visual contact.
                           The avioms give every musician (up to five) up to 16 channels of audio for them
                           to mix to their own taste. Most people find this quite liberating when tracking
                           or doing overdubs. It also frees us up to work exclusively on the sounds rather
                           than futz with everyone's headphone mix. On top of that it cuts back on setup time
                           which makes everyone happy!
