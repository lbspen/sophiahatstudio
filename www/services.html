               <p>
                  At Sophiahat, we are involved in just about all aspects of audio production for new media.
                  We record bands, develop singer/songwriter projects, produce audio books, create music for film,
                  the web and TV/Radio, score and create effects for video games, and just about anything else you
                  can imagine involving the production of sound. If you have a project that doesn&rsquo;t fall into any
                  of the categories below, don&rsquo;t write us off.  Instead, shoot us an email and let us convince you
                  that we are a great fit for your needs.
