                  All clients are encouraged to bring a hard drive for data backup. We can burn data
                  DVDs of your project, but it is far less reliable than a external hard drive.
                  Although we will maintain at least one copy of the client's active project,
                  we cannot assume responsibility for the clients data. That's why it is important
                  for the client to keep a copy for themselves. We clear our drives once the project
                  is completed.
                
               </p>
               <p>
                  Full payment is due at the end of the session, we accept cash, check or credit card. 

               </p>
               <p>
                Bookings are reserved with a $50 deposit which is applied to the balance at the session
                conclusion.  Clients that cancel their sessions within 48 hrs of the start will
                forfeit their $50 deposit.
               </p>
               <p>
              Sessions begin and end at the appointed time, please arrive promptly to maximize the
              time we have available to record your project.
