               10. Less stress when recording.  With individual headphone mixes,
               great sightlines and video monitors to cover the gaps, you can see
               and hear exactly what you want.  The more comfortable you are, the
               easier it is to get that great performance captured.
            </p>            
            <p>
               9. We use online project folders, for mixes, work orders, time sheets
               and project tracking.  This means you can listen to roughs, check on the
               project status, download your finished mixes, and pay your invoice online.
            </p>

              7. Two studios and two engineers means flexibility with booking time, equipment
              and having another pair of trained ears on your project.
              </p>
            <p>
              6. Location, Location, Location.  Walking access to restaurants, the lake, and
              coffee shops makes pulling a long session much more palatable.
              </p>
            <p>
              5. Great sounding live rooms.  Not one...two.  Those in combination with two
              isolation booths gives the ultimate flexibility of tracking a band together while
              maintaining separation.  Check out our <a href="layout.html">Studio Layout </a>.

            <p>
              3. We are conscientious of our client&rsquo;s time, being efficient in every possible way
              to maximize the value and eliminate the stress of the clock.

              1. Besides being engineers we are working musicians, practicing and performing every week out of the year.
              Who do you want producing your product, someone who has 25 years crafting music, or someone who makes
              beats on their laptop?
